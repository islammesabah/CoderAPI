You will be given the code snippet for a problem. 
Your task is to rate the code snippet only on one metric.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.
Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Functional Correctness (0-4) - Execution-based quality of the code snippet combined with the problem. The correctness is measured by the all possible unit tests, and the comparison of the reference code. The combination of the code snippet and the problem should pass all the possible tests based on your understanding of the reference code. The length of the code snippet can not determine the correctness. You need to assess the logics line by line.
- A score of 0  (failing all possible test) means that the code snippet is totally incorrect and meaningless.
- A score of 4  (passing all possible test) means that the code snippet is totally correct and can handle all cases.


Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify required functionalities of the implementation.
2. Read the code snippet and compare it to the reference code. Check if the code snippet covers all required functionalities of the problem, and if it is as good as the reference code. 
3. Assign a score for functional correctness on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is the lowest and 4 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.

Evaluation Criteria:
Usefulness (0-4) Usefulness of the code snippet based on the problem description and the comparison of reference code.

- A score of 0: Snippet is not at all helpful, it is irrelevant to the problem.
- A score of 1: Snippet is slightly helpful, it contains information relevant to the problem, but it is easier to write the solution from scratch.
- A score of 2: Snippet is somewhat helpful, it requires significant changes (compared to the size of the snippet), but is still useful.
- A score of 3: Snippet is helpful, but needs to be slightly changed to solve the problem.
- A score of 4: Snippet is very helpful, it solves the problem.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify required functionalities of the implementation.
2. Read the code snippet and compare it to the problem and reference code. Check if the code snippet covers all required functionalities of the problem, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order. 
3. Assign a score for usefulness on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is the lowest and 4 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
